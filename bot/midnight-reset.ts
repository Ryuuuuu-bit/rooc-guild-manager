 * below) — a previous version of this function deliberately skipped that to
 * avoid activity-feed noise, but that left a confirmed ATTENDANCE_LEAVE as
 * each such member's most recent event on that board FOREVER (nothing ever

 * leave stats (both driven by "what's the last LEAVE/RETURN logged for this
 * member+board" — see getLeaveMemberIds in src/lib/checkin-data.ts) keep
 * showing that member as on leave for every future round, even ones days or
 * weeks later, until someone happened to toggle them in/out of Busy/Leave
 * again — with nothing on the (now-empty-looking) party board itself to
 * suggest anything was wrong. Logging the return here keeps that history
 * honest: a small "Leave cancelled / returned" line for whoever was
 * actually on the list, once per board per night, in exchange for /checkin
 * and /attendance no longer permanently misattributing a stale leave.
